# Dear Lucy Coding Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains a simple React project for completing a short coding assignment. Read the detailed instructions below, implement the required functionality in [`client/ChartWidget/index.jsx`](client/ChartWidget/index.jsx). Create a pull request with your solution when you are satisfied with your work.

## Assignment
Implement a chart using data provided by the backend in [`server/routes/series.js`](server/routes/series.js). You can also modify the backend to suit your needs.

### Coding
The starting point of your solutions should be [`client/ChartWidget/index.jsx`](client/ChartWidget/index.jsx), but feel free to organize your code as you see fit. Focus on writing maintainable and easy to understand code over performance optimization. Lodash is already part of the project, but feel free to add new dependencies when needed.

### Testing
There is test skeleton in [`client/__tests__/ChartWidget.spec.jsx`](client/__tests__/ChartWidget.spec.jsx). Improve these tests to demonstrate the correctness of your solution. The tests can be run with the command ```npm test```.
